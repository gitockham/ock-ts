TSARK is a library client designed to facilitate how you interact with the ARK blockchain.

## Why TypeScript

  * TypeScript is is a superset of JavaScript which mainly offers optional static typing, classes, and interfaces. The learning curve is not that steep.
  * Types are optional, TSOCK compiles into ES5 so you can work with both, ECMAScript or TypeScript.
  * A better development experience, including auto-complete and fully documented.

## Documentation

> [API documentation](https://gitockham.github.io/ock-ts/) is hosted on github pages, and is generated from [TypeDoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc).

```bash
